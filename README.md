# Diagrams

## Overview

Diagrams is a template repository designed to standardize the initialization of new GitHub projects. This template ensures that every new project starts with a consistent structure and set of guidelines, helping teams and individual developers to kickstart their development process without needing to set up everything from scratch.

### Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/docs**: Documentation files and project guides.
- **/src**: Source code for the project.
- **/tests**: Test scripts and testing resources.
- **README.md**: The main informational file for the project, which you are currently reading.
- **LICENSE**: The license file detailing the usage rights.

## Setup and Installation

To use this template for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diagrams.git

2. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable):  
   Depending on the nature of your project, you may need to install certain dependencies. This can typically be done via a package manager:

   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Configure the necessary environment variables, settings, and any other project-specific requirements.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using the repository as a base for your project development. Here's an example of how you might begin to use the template:
